# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict passenger satisfaction based on various features like service ratings, flight conditions, and demographics. It leverages a dataset of 50,000 airline passengers and builds a classification model using a Random Forest algorithm.
